abstract: 'We address the resource allocation challenges in NextG cellular radio access networks (RAN), where heterogeneous user applications demand guarantees on throughput and service regularity. We leverage the Whittle indexability property to decompose the resource allocation problem, enabling the independent computation of relative priorities for each user. By simply allocating resources in decreasing order of these indices, we transform the combinatorial complexity of resource allocation into a linear one. We propose Windex, a lightweight approach for training neural networks to compute Whittle indices, considering constraint violation, channel quality, and system load. Implemented on a real-time RAN intelligent controller (RIC), our approach enables resource allocation decision times of less than 20Î¼s per user and efficiently allocates resources in each 1ms scheduling time slot. Evaluation across standardized 3GPP service classes demonstrates significant improvements in service guarantees compared to existing schedulers, validated through simulations and emulations with over-the-air channel traces on a 5G testbed.'
